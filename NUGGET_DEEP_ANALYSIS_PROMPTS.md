```
I'm analyzing why Nugget (chatbot) fails to resolve a specific issue category. I've attached:

üìä **DATA:**

---

## üéØ YOUR TASK: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

Analyze these conversations and identify **WHY** Nugget fails. Focus on root causes, not symptoms.

---

### **1. CATEGORIZE FAILURES**

For each conversation, identify the PRIMARY root cause:

**A. CAPABILITY GAPS** (Bot CAN'T do it)
- Missing API access (e.g., can't check freeze status)
- Missing data access (e.g., can't see transaction details)
- Missing feature (e.g., can't create callback)
- Missing integration (e.g., can't update ticket status)

**B. LOGIC ERRORS** (Bot SHOULD do it but doesn't)
- Incorrect flow logic
- Wrong decision tree
- Missing conditional branches
- Incorrect priority/sequencing

**C. KNOWLEDGE GAPS** (Bot doesn't KNOW how)
- SOP not implemented in bot
- Incomplete information in bot's knowledge base
- Outdated/incorrect information
- Missing edge cases

**D. UNDERSTANDING FAILURES** (Bot doesn't GET it)
- Can't understand user's intent
- Misinterprets user's question
- Can't handle variations in phrasing
- Fails on context switches

**E. EXECUTION FAILURES** (Bot tries but fails)
- API calls fail
- Data retrieval errors
- Timeout issues
- Integration problems
