#### 💡 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **Update Response:** Replace generic acknowledgments with specific diagnostic questions.
2. **Reduce Frustration:** Average 5.8 user messages before agent. Implement earlier escalation triggers.
3. **Add to Knowledge Base:** Agents use step-by-step guides. Add these detailed instructions to bot's knowledge.
4. **Escalation Flow:** This issue often requires backend intervention. Train bot to identify and escalate faster.
5. **Multi-Channel:** Agents provide alternative channels (WhatsApp/Email). Bot should offer these options earlier.
